The AWS SDK for JavaScript v2 has reached [end-of-support][v2-end-of-support] on **September 8, 2025**.
It will no longer receive updates or releases. Previously published versions are available on npm at
[aws-sdk][], and source code remains on GitHub at [aws/aws-sdk-js][].

We recommend that you migrate to [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3][v3-developer-guide], which has been GA
since December 2020. Here is [why and how you should use it][v3-recommended-blog]. You can try
migration scripts in [aws-sdk-js-codemod][] to migrate your application from v2 to v3.

To get help with your migration, please follow our general guidelines to
